# simple-js-app

JS App:


It's a small web application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. It is an app which lists over 50 different Pokemons.


In this app, after click on their name, a modal will open with a picture of the Pokemon as well as basic information about that Pokemon (height, weight, abilities and types). The information are loaded via API from an external database ie (<https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=50>).
